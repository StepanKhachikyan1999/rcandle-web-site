            <p>A candle is an ignitable wick embedded in wax, or another flammable solid substance such as tallow, that provides light, and in</p>
            <p>Some cases, a fragrance. A candle can also provide heat or a method of keeping time.</p>
            <br /><p>For a candle to burn, a heat source (commonly a naked flame from a match or lighter) is used to light the candle's wick, which</p>
            <p> Melts and vaporizes a small amount of fuel (the wax). Once vaporized, the fuel combines with oxygen in the atmosphere to ignite</p>
            <p> And form a constant flame. This flame provides sufficient heat to keep the candle burning via a self-sustaining chain of events:</p>
            <p> The heat of the flame melts the top of the mass of solid fuel; the liquefied fuel then moves upward through the wick via </p>
            <p>capillary action; the liquefied fuel finally vaporizes to burn within the candle's flame.</p>
